These how-to guides show how to implement human-in-the-loop workflows in your graph.\n\nKey workflows:\n\n  * How to wait for user input: A basic example that shows how to implement a human-in-the-loop workflow in your graph using the `interrupt` function.\n  * How to review tool calls: Incorporate human-in-the-loop for reviewing/editing/accepting tool call requests before they executed using the `interrupt` function.\n\n\n\nOther methods:\n\n  * How to add static breakpoints: Use for debugging purposes. For **human-in-the-loop** workflows, we recommend the `interrupt` function instead.\n  * How to edit graph state: Edit graph state using `graph.update_state` method. Use this if implementing a **human-in-the-loop** workflow via **static breakpoints**.\n  * How to add dynamic breakpoints with `NodeInterrupt`: **Not recommended** : Use the `interrupt` function instead.\n\n\n\nSee the below guides for how-to implement human-in-the-loop workflows with the (beta) Functional API:\n\n  * How to wait for user input (Functional API)\n  * How to review tool calls (Functional API)\n\n\n\n### Time Travel\u00b6\n\nTime travel allows you to replay past actions in your LangGraph application to explore alternative paths and debug issues.
