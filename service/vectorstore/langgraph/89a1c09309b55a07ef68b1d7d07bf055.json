This is why many LLM applications use a control flow of steps before and / or after LLM calls. As an example RAG performs retrieval of relevant documents to a question, and passes those documents to an LLM in order to ground the response. Often a control flow of steps before and / or after an LLM is called a \"chain.\" Chains are a popular paradigm for programming with LLMs and offer a high degree of reliability; the same set of steps runs with each chain invocation.\n\nHowever, we often want LLM systems that can pick their own control flow! This is one definition of an agent: an agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. Unlike a chain, an agent given an LLM some degree of control over the sequence of steps in the application. Examples of using an LLM to decide the control of an application:\n\n  * Using an LLM to route between two potential paths\n  * Using an LLM to decide which of many tools to call\n  * Using an LLM to decide whether the generated answer is sufficient or more work is need\n\n\n\nThere are many different types of agent architectures to consider, which given an LLM varying levels of control. On one extreme, a router allows an LLM to select a single step from a specified set of options and, on the other extreme, a fully autonomous long-running agent may have complete freedom to select any sequence of steps that it wants for a given problem. \n\nSeveral concepts are utilized in many agent architectures:\n\n  * Tool calling: this is often how LLMs make decisions\n  * Action taking: often times, the LLMs' outputs are used as the input to an action\n  * Memory: reliable systems need to have knowledge of things that occurred\n  * Planning: planning steps (either explicit or implicit) are useful for ensuring that the LLM, when making decisions, makes them in the highest fidelity way.\n\n\n\n## Challenges\u00b6\n\nIn practice, there is often a trade-off between control and reliability. As we give LLMs more control, the application often become less reliable. This can be due to factors such as LLM non-determinism and / or errors in selecting tools (or steps) that the agent uses (takes).\n\n## Core Principles\u00b6\n\nThe motivation of LangGraph is to help bend the curve, preserving higher reliability as we give the agent more control over the application. We'll outline a few specific pillars of LangGraph that make it well suited for building reliable agents. \n\n**Controllability**\n\nLangGraph gives the developer a high degree of control by expressing the flow of the application as a set of nodes and edges. All nodes can access and modify a common state (memory). The control flow of the application can set using edges that connect nodes, either deterministically or via conditional logic. \n\n**Persistence**\n\nLangGraph gives the developer many options for persisting graph state using short-term or long-term (e.g., via a database) memory. \n\n**Human-in-the-Loop**\n\nThe persistence layer enables several different human-in-the-loop interaction patterns with agents; for example, it's possible to pause an agent, review its state, edit it state, and approve a follow-up step. \n\n**Streaming**\n\nLangGraph comes with first class support for streaming, which can expose state to the user (or developer) over the course of agent execution. LangGraph supports streaming of both events (like a tool call being taken) as well as of tokens that an LLM may emit.\n\n## Debugging\u00b6\n\nOnce you've built a graph, you often want to test and debug it. LangGraph Studio is a specialized IDE for visualization and debugging of LangGraph applications.\n\n## Deployment\u00b6\n\nOnce you have confidence in your LangGraph application, many developers want an easy path to deployment. LangGraph Cloud is an opinionated, simple way to deploy LangGraph objects from the LangChain team. Of course, you can also use services like Express.js and call your graph from inside the Express.js server as you see fit.\n",
