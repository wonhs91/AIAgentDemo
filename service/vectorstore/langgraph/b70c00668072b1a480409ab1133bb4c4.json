This chatbot will respond directly to user messages. Though simple, it will illustrate the core concepts of building with LangGraph. By the end of this section, you will have a built rudimentary chatbot.\n\nStart by creating a `StateGraph`. A `StateGraph` object defines the structure of our chatbot as a \"state machine\". We'll add `nodes` to represent the llm and functions our chatbot can call and `edges` to specify how the bot should transition between these functions.\n[code] \n    from typing import Annotated\n    \n    from typing_extensions import TypedDict\n    \n    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n    \n    \n    class State(TypedDict):\n        # Messages have the type \"list\". The `add_messages` function\n        # in the annotation defines how this state key should be updated\n        # (in this case, it appends messages to the list, rather than overwriting them)\n        messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n    \n    \n    graph_builder = StateGraph(State)\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: StateGraph | START | END | add_messages\n\nOur graph can now handle two key tasks:\n\n  1. Each `node` can receive the current `State` as input and output an update to the state.\n  2. Updates to `messages` will be appended to the existing list rather than overwriting it, thanks to the prebuilt `add_messages` function used with the `Annotated` syntax.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nConcept\n\nWhen defining a graph, the first step is to define its `State`. The `State` includes the graph's schema and reducer functions that handle state updates. In our example, `State` is a `TypedDict` with one key: `messages`. The `add_messages` reducer function is used to append new messages to the list instead of overwriting it. Keys without a reducer annotation will overwrite previous values. Learn more about state, reducers, and related concepts in this guide.\n\n* * *\n\nNext, add a \"`chatbot`\" node. Nodes represent units of work. They are typically regular python functions.\n[code] \n    from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n    \n    llm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n    \n    \n    def chatbot(state: State):\n        return {\"messages\": [llm.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\n    \n    \n    # The first argument is the unique node name\n    # The second argument is the function or object that will be called whenever\n    # the node is used.\n    graph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic\n\n**Notice** how the `chatbot` node function takes the current `State` as input and returns a dictionary containing an updated `messages` list under the key \"messages\". This is the basic pattern for all LangGraph node functions.\n\nThe `add_messages` function in our `State` will append the llm's response messages to whatever messages are already in the state.\n\nNext, add an `entry` point. This tells our graph **where to start its work** each time we run it.\n[code] \n    graph_builder.add_edge(START, \"chatbot\")\n    \n[/code]\n\nSimilarly, set a `finish` point. This instructs the graph **\"any time this node is run, you can exit.\"**\n[code] \n    graph_builder.add_edge(\"chatbot\", END)\n    \n[/code]\n\nFinally, we'll want to be able to run our graph. To do so, call \"`compile()`\" on the graph builder. This creates a \"`CompiledGraph`\" we can use invoke on our state.\n[code] \n    graph = graph_builder.compile()\n    \n[/code]\n\nYou can visualize the graph using the `get_graph` method and one of the \"draw\" methods, like `draw_ascii` or `draw_png`. The `draw` methods each require additional dependencies.\n[code] \n    from IPython.display import Image, display\n    \n    try:\n        display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n    except Exception:\n        # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional\n        pass\n    \n[/code]\n\nNow let's run the chatbot! \n\n**Tip:** You can exit the chat loop at any time by typing \"quit\", \"exit\", or \"q\".\n[code] \n    def stream_graph_updates(user_input: str):\n        for event in graph.stream({\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}]}):\n            for value in event.values():\n                print(\"Assistant:\", value[\"messages\"][-1].content)\n    \n    \n    while True:\n        try:\n            user_input = input(\"User: \")\n            if user_input.lower() in [\"quit\", \"exit\", \"q\"]:\n                print(\"Goodbye!\")\n                break\n    \n            stream_graph_updates(user_input)\n        except:\n            # fallback if input() is not available\n            user_input = \"What do you know about LangGraph?\"\n            print(\"User: \" + user_input)\n            stream_graph_updates(user_input)\n            break\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    Assistant: LangGraph is a library designed to help build stateful multi-agent applications using language models. It provides tools for creating workflows and state machines to coordinate multiple AI agents or language model interactions. LangGraph is built on top of LangChain, leveraging its components while adding graph-based coordination capabilities. It's particularly useful for developing more complex, stateful AI applications that go beyond simple query-response interactions.\n    Goodbye!\n    \n[/code]\n\n**Congratulations!** You've built your first chatbot using LangGraph. This bot can engage in basic conversation by taking user input and generating responses using an LLM. You can inspect a LangSmith Trace for the call above at the provided link.\n\nHowever, you may have noticed that the bot's knowledge is limited to what's in its training data. In the next part, we'll add a web search tool to expand the bot's knowledge and make it more capable.\n\nBelow is the full code for this section for your reference:\n\nFull Code\n[code] \n    \n    \n[code]\n    from typing import Annotated\n    \n    from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n    from typing_extensions import TypedDict\n    \n    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n    \n    \n    class State(TypedDict):\n        messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n    \n    \n    graph_builder = StateGraph(State)\n    \n    \n    llm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n    \n    \n    def chatbot(state: State):\n        return {\"messages\": [llm.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\n    \n    \n    # The first argument is the unique node name\n    # The second argument is the function or object that will be called whenever\n    # the node is used.\n    graph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\n    graph_builder.set_entry_point(\"chatbot\")\n    graph_builder.set_finish_point(\"chatbot\")\n    graph = graph_builder.compile()\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | StateGraph | add_messages\n[/code]\n\n## Part 2: \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Enhancing the Chatbot with Tools\u00b6\n\nTo handle queries our chatbot can't answer \"from memory\", we'll integrate a web search tool. Our bot can use this tool to find relevant information and provide better responses.\n\n#### Requirements\u00b6\n\nBefore we start, make sure you have the necessary packages installed and API keys set up:\n\nFirst, install the requirements to use the Tavily Search Engine, and set your TAVILY_API_KEY.\n[code] \n    %%capture --no-stderr\n    %pip install -U tavily-python langchain_community\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    _set_env(\"TAVILY_API_KEY\")\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    TAVILY_API_KEY:  \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n    \n[/code]\n\nNext, define the tool:\n[code] \n    from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\n    \n    tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\n    tools = [tool]\n    tool.invoke(\"What's a 'node' in LangGraph?\")\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: TavilySearchResults\n[code] \n    [{'url': 'https://medium.com/@cplog/introduction-to-langgraph-a-beginners-guide-14f9be027141',\n      'content': 'Nodes: Nodes are the building blocks of your LangGraph.

Each node performs a specific task on the product. In LangGraph, nodes are Python functions that take the current state, do some work, and return an updated state. Next, we define the nodes, each representing a task in our sandwich-making process.'}]\n    \n[/code]\n\nThe results are page summaries our chat bot can use to answer questions.\n\nNext, we'll start defining our graph. The following is all **the same as in Part 1** , except we have added `bind_tools` on our LLM. This lets the LLM know the correct JSON format to use if it wants to use our search engine.\n[code] \n    from typing import Annotated\n    \n    from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n    from typing_extensions import TypedDict\n    \n    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n    \n    \n    class State(TypedDict):\n        messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n    \n    \n    graph_builder = StateGraph(State)\n    \n    \n    llm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n    # Modification: tell the LLM which tools it can call\n    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n    \n    \n    def chatbot(state: State):\n        return {\"messages\": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\n    \n    \n    graph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages\n\nNext we need to create a function to actually run the tools if they are called. We'll do this by adding the tools to a new node.\n\nBelow, we implement a `BasicToolNode` that checks the most recent message in the state and calls tools if the message contains `tool_calls`. It relies on the LLM's `tool_calling` support, which is available in Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and a number of other LLM providers.\n\nWe will later replace this with LangGraph's prebuilt ToolNode to speed things up, but building it ourselves first is instructive.\n[code] \n    import json\n    \n    from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage\n    \n    \n    class BasicToolNode:\n        \"\"\"A node that runs the tools requested in the last AIMessage.\"\"\"\n    \n        def __init__(self, tools: list) -> None:\n            self.tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}\n    \n        def __call__(self, inputs: dict):\n            if messages := inputs.get(\"messages\", []):\n                message = messages[-1]\n            else:\n                raise ValueError(\"No message found in input\")\n            outputs = []\n            for tool_call in message.tool_calls:\n                tool_result = self.tools_by_name[tool_call[\"name\"]].invoke(\n                    tool_call[\"args\"]\n                )\n                outputs.append(\n                    ToolMessage(\n                        content=json.dumps(tool_result),\n                        name=tool_call[\"name\"],\n                        tool_call_id=tool_call[\"id\"],\n                    )\n                )\n            return {\"messages\": outputs}\n    \n    \n    tool_node = BasicToolNode(tools=[tool])\n    graph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: ToolMessage\n\nWith the tool node added, we can define the `conditional_edges`. \n\nRecall that **edges** route the control flow from one node to the next. **Conditional edges** usually contain \"if\" statements to route to different nodes depending on the current graph state. These functions receive the current graph `state` and return a string or list of strings indicating which node(s) to call next.\n\nBelow, call define a router function called `route_tools`, that checks for tool_calls in the chatbot's output. Provide this function to the graph by calling `add_conditional_edges`, which tells the graph that whenever the `chatbot` node completes to check this function to see where to go next. \n\nThe condition will route to `tools` if tool calls are present and `END` if not.\n\nLater, we will replace this with the prebuilt tools_condition to be more concise, but implementing it ourselves first makes things more clear. \n[code] \n    def route_tools(\n        state: State,\n    ):\n        \"\"\"\n        Use in the conditional_edge to route to the ToolNode if the last message\n        has tool calls. Otherwise, route to the end.\n        \"\"\"\n        if isinstance(state, list):\n            ai_message = state[-1]\n        elif messages := state.get(\"messages\", []):\n            ai_message = messages[-1]\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"No messages found in input state to tool_edge: {state}\")\n        if hasattr(ai_message, \"tool_calls\") and len(ai_message.tool_calls) > 0:\n            return \"tools\"\n        return END\n    \n    \n    # The `tools_condition` function returns \"tools\" if the chatbot asks to use a tool, and \"END\" if\n    # it is fine directly responding. This conditional routing defines the main agent loop.\n    graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\n        \"chatbot\",\n        route_tools,\n        # The following dictionary lets you tell the graph to interpret the condition's outputs as a specific node\n        # It defaults to the identity function, but if you\n        # want to use a node named something else apart from \"tools\",\n        # You can update the value of the dictionary to something else\n        # e.g., \"tools\": \"my_tools\"\n        {\"tools\": \"tools\", END: END},\n    )\n    # Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step\n    graph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\n    graph_builder.add_edge(START, \"chatbot\")\n    graph = graph_builder.compile()\n    \n[/code]\n\n**Notice** that conditional edges start from a single node. This tells the graph \"any time the '`chatbot`' node runs, either go to 'tools' if it calls a tool, or end the loop if it responds directly. \n\nLike the prebuilt `tools_condition`, our function returns the `END` string if no tool calls are made. When the graph transitions to `END`, it has no more tasks to complete and ceases execution. Because the condition can return `END`, we don't need to explicitly set a `finish_point` this time. Our graph already has a way to finish!\n\nLet's visualize the graph we've built. The following function has some additional dependencies to run that are unimportant for this tutorial.\n[code] \n    from IPython.display import Image, display\n    \n    try:\n        display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n    except Exception:\n        # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional\n        pass\n    \n[/code]\n\nNow we can ask the bot questions outside its training data.\n[code] \n    while True:\n        try:\n            user_input = input(\"User: \")\n            if user_input.lower() in [\"quit\", \"exit\", \"q\"]:\n                print(\"Goodbye!\")\n                break\n    \n            stream_graph_updates(user_input)\n        except:\n            # fallback if input() is not available\n            user_input = \"What do you know about LangGraph?\"\n            print(\"User: \" + user_input)\n            stream_graph_updates(user_input)\n            break\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    Assistant: [{'text': \"To provide you with accurate and up-to-date information about LangGraph, I'll need to search for the latest details.

Now it can handle a wider range of user queries. To inspect all the steps your agent just took, check out this LangSmith trace.\n\nOur chatbot still can't remember past interactions on its own, limiting its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the next part, we'll add **memory** to address this.\n\nThe full code for the graph we've created in this section is reproduced below, replacing our `BasicToolNode` for the prebuilt ToolNode, and our `route_tools` condition with the prebuilt tools_condition\n\nFull Code\n[code] \n    \n    \n[code]\n    from typing import Annotated\n    \n    from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n    from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\n    from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage\n    from typing_extensions import TypedDict\n    \n    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n    from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\n    \n    \n    class State(TypedDict):\n        messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n    \n    \n    graph_builder = StateGraph(State)\n    \n    \n    tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\n    tools = [tool]\n    llm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n    \n    \n    def chatbot(state: State):\n        return {\"messages\": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\n    \n    \n    graph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\n    \n    tool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])\n    graph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\n    \n    graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\n        \"chatbot\",\n        tools_condition,\n    )\n    # Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step\n    graph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\n    graph_builder.set_entry_point(\"chatbot\")\n    graph = graph_builder.compile()\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | BaseMessage | StateGraph | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition\n[/code]\n\n## Part 3: Adding Memory to the Chatbot\u00b6\n\nOur chatbot can now use tools to answer user questions, but it doesn't remember the context of previous interactions. This limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations.\n\nLangGraph solves this problem through **persistent checkpointing**. If you provide a `checkpointer` when compiling the graph and a `thread_id` when calling your graph, LangGraph automatically saves the state after each step. When you invoke the graph again using the same `thread_id`, the graph loads its saved state, allowing the chatbot to pick up where it left off. \n\nWe will see later that **checkpointing** is _much_ more powerful than simple chat memory - it lets you save and resume complex state at any time for error recovery, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel interactions, and more. But before we get too ahead of ourselves, let's add checkpointing to enable multi-turn conversations.\n\nTo get started, create a `MemorySaver` checkpointer.\n[code] \n    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\n    \n    memory = MemorySaver()\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: MemorySaver\n\n**Notice** we're using an in-memory checkpointer. This is convenient for our tutorial (it saves it all in-memory). In a production application, you would likely change this to use `SqliteSaver` or `PostgresSaver` and connect to your own DB.\n\nNext define the graph. Now that you've already built your own `BasicToolNode`, we'll replace it with LangGraph's prebuilt `ToolNode` and `tools_condition`, since these do some nice things like parallel API execution. Apart from that, the following is all copied from Part 2.\n[code] \n    from typing import Annotated\n    \n    from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n    from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\n    from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage\n    from typing_extensions import TypedDict\n    \n    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n    from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\n    \n    \n    class State(TypedDict):\n        messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n    \n    \n    graph_builder = StateGraph(State)\n    \n    \n    tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\n    tools = [tool]\n    llm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n    \n    \n    def chatbot(state: State):\n        return {\"messages\": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\n    \n    \n    graph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\n    \n    tool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])\n    graph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\n    \n    graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\n        \"chatbot\",\n        tools_condition,\n    )\n    # Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step\n    graph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\n    graph_builder.add_edge(START, \"chatbot\")\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | BaseMessage | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition\n\nFinally, compile the graph with the provided checkpointer.\n[code] \n    graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n    \n[/code]\n\nNotice the connectivity of the graph hasn't changed since Part 2. All we are doing is checkpointing the `State` as the graph works through each node.\n[code] \n    from IPython.display import Image, display\n    \n    try:\n        display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\n    except Exception:\n        # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional\n        pass\n    \n[/code]\n\nNow you can interact with your bot!

See this call's LangSmith trace for comparison. \n\nBy now, we have made a few checkpoints across two different threads. But what goes into a checkpoint? To inspect a graph's `state` for a given config at any time, call `get_state(config)`.\n[code] \n    snapshot = graph.get_state(config)\n    snapshot\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    StateSnapshot(values={'messages': [HumanMessage(content='Hi there!

This opens up exciting possibilities for more natural, contextual interactions. LangGraph's checkpointing even handles **arbitrarily complex graph states** , which is much more expressive and powerful than simple chat memory.\n\nIn the next part, we'll introduce human oversight to our bot to handle situations where it may need guidance or verification before proceeding.\n\nCheck out the code snippet below to review our graph from this section.\n\nFull Code\n[code] \n    \n    \n[code]\n    from typing import Annotated\n    \n    from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n    from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\n    from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage\n    from typing_extensions import TypedDict\n    \n    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\n    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph\n    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n    from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode\n    \n    \n    class State(TypedDict):\n        messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n    \n    \n    graph_builder = StateGraph(State)\n    \n    \n    tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\n    tools = [tool]\n    llm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n    \n    \n    def chatbot(state: State):\n        return {\"messages\": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\n    \n    \n    graph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\n    \n    tool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])\n    graph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\n    \n    graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\n        \"chatbot\",\n        tools_condition,\n    )\n    graph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\n    graph_builder.set_entry_point(\"chatbot\")\n    memory = MemorySaver()\n    graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | BaseMessage | MemorySaver | StateGraph | add_messages | ToolNode\n[/code]\n\n## Part 4: Human-in-the-loop\u00b6\n\nAgents can be unreliable and may need human input to successfully accomplish tasks. Similarly, for some actions, you may want to require human approval before running to ensure that everything is running as intended.\n\nLangGraph's persistence layer supports human-in-the-loop workflows, allowing execution to pause and resume based on user feedback. The primary interface to this functionality is the interrupt function. Calling `interrupt` inside a node will pause execution. Execution can be resumed, together with new input from a human, by passing in a Command. `interrupt` is ergonomically similar to Python's built-in `input()`, with some caveats. We demonstrate an example below.\n\nFirst, start with our existing code from Part 3. We will make one change, which is to add a simple `human_assistance` tool accessible to the chatbot. This tool uses `interrupt` to receive information from a human.\n[code] \n    from typing import Annotated\n    \n    from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n    from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\n    from langchain_core.tools import tool\n    from typing_extensions import TypedDict\n    \n    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\n    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n    from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\n    \n    from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt\n    \n    \n    class State(TypedDict):\n        messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n    \n    \n    graph_builder = StateGraph(State)\n    \n    \n    @tool\n    def human_assistance(query: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Request assistance from a human.\"\"\"\n        human_response = interrupt({\"query\": query})\n        return human_response[\"data\"]\n    \n    \n    tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\n    tools = [tool, human_assistance]\n    llm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n    \n    \n    def chatbot(state: State):\n        message = llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])\n        # Because we will be interrupting during tool execution,\n        # we disable parallel tool calling to avoid repeating any\n        # tool invocations when we resume.\n        assert len(message.tool_calls) <= 1\n        return {\"messages\": [message]}\n    \n    \n    graph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\n    \n    tool_node = ToolNode(tools=tools)\n    graph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\n    \n    graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\n        \"chatbot\",\n        tools_condition,\n    )\n    graph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\n    graph_builder.add_edge(START, \"chatbot\")\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | tool | MemorySaver | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition | Command | interrupt\n\n* * *\n\nTip\n\nCheck out the Human-in-the-loop section of the How-to Guides for more examples of Human-in-the-loop workflows, including how to review and edit tool calls before they are executed.\n\n* * *\n\nWe compile the graph with a checkpointer, as before:\n[code] \n    memory = MemorySaver()\n    \n    graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n    \n[/code]\n\nVisualizing the graph, we recover the same layout as before.

Note that if we inspect the graph state, we see that it stopped at the tools node:\n[code] \n    snapshot = graph.get_state(config)\n    snapshot.next\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    ('tools',)\n    \n[/code]\n\nLet's take a closer look at the `human_assistance` tool:\n[code] \n    @tool\n    def human_assistance(query: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Request assistance from a human.\"\"\"\n        human_response = interrupt({\"query\": query})\n        return human_response[\"data\"]\n    \n[/code]\n\nSimilar to Python's built-in `input()` function, calling `interrupt` inside the tool will pause execution. Progress is persisted based on our choice of checkpointer\\-- so if we are persisting with Postgres, we can resume at any time as long as the database is alive. Here we are persisting with the in-memory checkpointer, so we can resume any time as long as our Python kernel is running.\n\nTo resume execution, we pass a Command object containing data expected by the tool. The format of this data can be customized based on our needs. Here, we just need a dict with a key `\"data\"`:\n[code] \n    human_response = (\n        \"We, the experts are here to help!

We'd recommend you check out LangGraph to build your agent. It's much more reliable and extensible than simple autonomous agents.\n    ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m==================================\n    \n    Thank you for your patience. I've received some expert advice regarding your request for guidance on building an AI agent. Here's what the experts have suggested:\n    \n    The experts recommend that you look into LangGraph for building your AI agent. They mention that LangGraph is a more reliable and extensible option compared to simple autonomous agents.\n    \n    LangGraph is likely a framework or library designed specifically for creating AI agents with advanced capabilities. Here are a few points to consider based on this recommendation:\n    \n    1. Reliability: The experts emphasize that LangGraph is more reliable than simpler autonomous agent approaches. This could mean it has better stability, error handling, or consistent performance.\n    \n    2. Extensibility: LangGraph is described as more extensible, which suggests that it probably offers a flexible architecture that allows you to easily add new features or modify existing ones as your agent's requirements evolve.\n    \n    3. Advanced capabilities: Given that it's recommended over \"simple autonomous agents,\" LangGraph likely provides more sophisticated tools and techniques for building complex AI agents.\n    \n    To get started with LangGraph, you might want to:\n    \n    1. Search for the official LangGraph documentation or website to learn more about its features and how to use it.\n    2. Look for tutorials or guides specifically focused on building AI agents with LangGraph.\n    3. Check if there are any community forums or discussion groups where you can ask questions and get support from other developers using LangGraph.\n    \n    If you'd like more specific information about LangGraph or have any questions about this recommendation, please feel free to ask, and I can request further assistance from the experts.\n    \n[/code]\n\nOur input has been received and processed as a tool message. Review this call's LangSmith trace to see the exact work that was done in the above call. Notice that the state is loaded in the first step so that our chatbot can continue where it left off.\n\n**Congrats!** You've used an `interrupt` to add human-in-the-loop execution to your chatbot, allowing for human oversight and intervention when needed. This opens up the potential UIs you can create with your AI systems. Since we have already added a **checkpointer** , as long as the underlying persistence layer is running, the graph can be paused **indefinitely** and resumed at any time as if nothing had happened.\n\nHuman-in-the-loop workflows enable a variety of new workflows and user experiences.

You can go far with this simple state, but if you want to define complex behavior without relying on the message list, you can add additional fields to the state. Here we will demonstrate a new scenario, in which the chatbot is using its search tool to find specific information, and forwarding them to a human for review. Let's have the chatbot research the birthday of an entity. We will add `name` and `birthday` keys to the state:\n[code] \n    from typing import Annotated\n    \n    from typing_extensions import TypedDict\n    \n    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n    \n    \n    class State(TypedDict):\n        messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n        name: str\n        birthday: str\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: add_messages\n\nAdding this information to the state makes it easily accessible by other graph nodes (e.g., a downstream node that stores or processes the information), as well as the graph's persistence layer.\n\nHere, we will populate the state keys inside of our `human_assistance` tool. This allows a human to review the information before it is stored in the state. We will again use `Command`, this time to issue a state update from inside our tool. Read more about use cases for `Command` here.\n[code] \n    from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage\n    from langchain_core.tools import InjectedToolCallId, tool\n    \n    from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt\n    \n    \n    @tool\n    # Note that because we are generating a ToolMessage for a state update, we\n    # generally require the ID of the corresponding tool call.

We will direct the chatbot to reach out to the `human_assistance` tool once it has the required information.

I can now provide you with the correct information about LangGraph's release date.\n    \n    LangGraph was initially released on January 17, 2024. This information comes from the human assistance correction, which is more accurate than the search results I initially found.\n    \n    To summarize:\n    1. LangGraph's original release date: January 17, 2024\n    2. LangGraph Cloud announcement: June 27, 2024\n    \n    It's worth noting that LangGraph had been in development and use for some time before the LangGraph Cloud announcement, but the official initial release of LangGraph itself was on January 17, 2024.\n    \n[/code]\n\nNote that these fields are now reflected in the state:\n[code] \n    snapshot = graph.get_state(config)\n    \n    {k: v for k, v in snapshot.values.items() if k in (\"name\", \"birthday\")}\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    {'name': 'LangGraph', 'birthday': 'Jan 17, 2024'}\n    \n[/code]\n\nThis makes them easily accessible to downstream nodes (e.g., a node that further processes or stores the information).\n\n### Manually updating state\u00b6\n\nLangGraph gives a high degree of control over the application state. For instance, at any point (including when interrupted), we can manually override a key using `graph.update_state`:\n[code] \n    graph.update_state(config, {\"name\": \"LangGraph (library)\"})\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1',\n      'checkpoint_ns': '',\n      'checkpoint_id': '1efd4ec5-cf69-6352-8006-9278f1730162'}}\n    \n[/code]\n\nIf we call `graph.get_state`, we can see the new value is reflected:\n[code] \n    snapshot = graph.get_state(config)\n    \n    {k: v for k, v in snapshot.values.items() if k in (\"name\", \"birthday\")}\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    {'name': 'LangGraph (library)', 'birthday': 'Jan 17, 2024'}\n    \n[/code]\n\nManual state updates will even generate a trace in LangSmith. If desired, they can also be used to control human-in-the-loop workflows, as described in this guide. Use of the `interrupt` function is generally recommended instead, as it allows data to be transmitted in a human-in-the-loop interaction independently of state updates.\n\n**Congratulations!** You've added custom keys to the state to facilitate a more complex workflow, and learned how to generate state updates from inside tools.\n\nWe're almost done with the tutorial, but there is one more concept we'd like to review before finishing that connects `checkpointing` and `state updates`. \n\nThis section's code is reproduced below for your reference.\n\nFull Code\n[code] \n    \n    \n[code]\n    from typing import Annotated\n    \n    from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n    from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\n    from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage\n    from langchain_core.tools import InjectedToolCallId, tool\n    from typing_extensions import TypedDict\n    \n    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\n    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n    from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\n    from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt\n    \n    \n    \n    class State(TypedDict):\n        messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n        name: str\n        birthday: str\n    \n    \n    @tool\n    def human_assistance(\n        name: str, birthday: str, tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId]\n    ) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Request assistance from a human.\"\"\"\n        human_response = interrupt(\n            {\n                \"question\": \"Is this correct?\",\n                \"name\": name,\n                \"birthday\": birthday,\n            },\n        )\n        if human_response.get(\"correct\", \"\").lower().startswith(\"y\"):\n            verified_name = name\n            verified_birthday = birthday\n            response = \"Correct\"\n        else:\n            verified_name = human_response.get(\"name\", name)\n            verified_birthday = human_response.get(\"birthday\", birthday)\n            response = f\"Made a correction: {human_response}\"\n    \n        state_update = {\n            \"name\": verified_name,\n            \"birthday\": verified_birthday,\n            \"messages\": [ToolMessage(response, tool_call_id=tool_call_id)],\n        }\n        return Command(update=state_update)\n    \n    \n    tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\n    tools = [tool, human_assistance]\n    llm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n    \n    \n    def chatbot(state: State):\n        message = llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])\n        assert(len(message.tool_calls) <= 1)\n        return {\"messages\": [message]}\n    \n    \n    graph_builder = StateGraph(State)\n    graph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\n    \n    tool_node = ToolNode(tools=tools)\n    graph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\n    \n    graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\n        \"chatbot\",\n        tools_condition,\n    )\n    graph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\n    graph_builder.add_edge(START, \"chatbot\")\n    \n    memory = MemorySaver()\n    graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | ToolMessage | InjectedToolCallId | tool | MemorySaver | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition | Command | interrupt\n[/code]\n\n## Part 6: Time Travel\u00b6\n\nIn a typical chat bot workflow, the user interacts with the bot 1 or more times to accomplish a task. In the previous sections, we saw how to add memory and a human-in-the-loop to be able to checkpoint our graph state and control future responses.\n\nBut what if you want to let your user start from a previous response and \"branch off\" to explore a separate outcome? Or what if you want users to be able to \"rewind\" your assistant's work to fix some mistakes or try a different strategy (common in applications like autonomous software engineers)?\n\nYou can create both of these experiences and more using LangGraph's built-in \"time travel\" functionality. \n\nIn this section, you will \"rewind\" your graph by fetching a checkpoint using the graph's `get_state_history` method. You can then resume execution at this previous point in time.\n\nFor this, let's use the simple chatbot with tools from Part 3:\n[code] \n    from typing import Annotated\n    \n    from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\n    from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\n    from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage\n    from typing_extensions import TypedDict\n    \n    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\n    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\n    from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\n    \n    \n    class State(TypedDict):\n        messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\n    \n    \n    graph_builder = StateGraph(State)\n    \n    \n    tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\n    tools = [tool]\n    llm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\n    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n    \n    \n    def chatbot(state: State):\n        return {\"messages\": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\n    \n    \n    graph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\n    \n    tool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])\n    graph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\n    \n    graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\n        \"chatbot\",\n        tools_condition,\n    )\n    graph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\n    graph_builder.add_edge(START, \"chatbot\")\n    \n    memory = MemorySaver()\n    graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\n    \n[/code]\n\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | BaseMessage | MemorySaver | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition\n\nLet's have our graph take a couple steps. Every step will be checkpointed in its state history:\n[code] \n    config = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\n    events = graph.stream(\n        {\n            \"messages\": [\n                {\n                    \"role\": \"user\",\n                    \"content\": (\n                        \"I'm learning LangGraph. \"\n                        \"Could you do some research on it for me?\"\n                    ),\n                },\n            ],\n        },\n        config,\n        stream_mode=\"values\",\n    )\n    for event in events:\n        if \"messages\" in event:\n            event[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    ================================\u001b[1m Human Message \u001b[0m=================================\n    \n    I'm learning LangGraph.

LangGraph Platform: This is a newly introduced concept that combines several offerings:\n          - LangGraph Server\n          - LangGraph Studio\n          - CLI (Command Line Interface)\n          - SDK (Software Development Kit)\n    \n    3. LangGraph Server: This component has received new features to enhance its value proposition, though the specific features weren't detailed in the search results.\n    \n    4. LangGraph Studio: This appears to be a new tool in the LangGraph ecosystem, likely providing a graphical interface for working with LangGraph.\n    \n    5. Documentation: The LangGraph documentation has been revamped, which should make it easier for learners like yourself to understand and use the tool.\n    \n    6. Integration with LangSmith: While not directly part of LangGraph, LangSmith (another tool in the LangChain ecosystem) now features self-improving evaluators, which might be relevant if you're using LangGraph as part of a larger LangChain project.\n    \n    As you're learning LangGraph, it would be beneficial to:\n    \n    1. Check out the official LangChain documentation, especially the newly revamped LangGraph sections.\n    2. Explore the different components of the LangGraph Platform (Server, Studio, CLI, and SDK) to see which best fits your learning needs.\n    3.

Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs): You can combine LangGraph with powerful LLMs like Gemini 2.0 to create more intelligent and capable agents. The LLM can serve as the \"brain\" of your agent, making decisions and generating responses.\n    \n    3. Workflow Management: LangGraph excels at managing complex, multi-step AI workflows. This is crucial for autonomous agents that need to break down tasks into smaller steps and execute them in the right order.\n    \n    4. Practical Tutorials Available: There are tutorials available that provide full code examples for building and running multi-tool agents. These can be incredibly helpful as you start your project.\n    \n    5. Langchain Integration: LangGraph is often used in conjunction with Langchain. This combination provides a powerful framework for building AI agents, offering features like memory management, tool integration, and prompt management.\n    \n    6. GitHub Resources: There are repositories available (like the one by anmolaman20) that provide comprehensive resources for building AI agents using Langchain and LangGraph. These can be valuable references as you develop your agent.\n    \n    7. Real-time Adaptation: LangGraph allows you to create agents that can think, reason, and adapt in real-time, which is crucial for truly autonomous behavior.\n    \n    8. Customization: You can equip your agent with specific tools tailored to your use case. For example, you might include tools for web searching, data analysis, or interacting with specific APIs.\n    \n    To get started with your autonomous agent project:\n    \n    1. Familiarize yourself with LangGraph's documentation and basic concepts.\n    2. Look into tutorials that specifically deal with building autonomous agents, like the one mentioned from Towards Data Science.\n    3. Decide on the specific capabilities you want your agent to have and identify the tools it will need.\n    4. Start with a simple agent and gradually add complexity as you become more comfortable with the framework.\n    5. Experiment with different LLMs to find the one that works best for your use case.\n    6. Pay attention to how you structure the agent's decision-making process and workflow.\n    7. Don't forget to implement proper error handling and safety measures, especially if your agent will be interacting with external systems or making important decisions.\n    \n    Building an autonomous agent is an iterative process, so be prepared to refine and improve your agent over time. Good luck with your project! If you need any more specific information as you progress, feel free to ask.\n    \n[/code]\n\nNow that we've had the agent take a couple steps, we can `replay` the full state history to see everything that occurred.\n[code] \n    to_replay = None\n    for state in graph.get_state_history(config):\n        print(\"Num Messages: \", len(state.values[\"messages\"]), \"Next: \", state.next)\n        print(\"-\" * 80)\n        if len(state.values[\"messages\"]) == 6:\n            # We are somewhat arbitrarily selecting a specific state based on the number of chat messages in the state.\n            to_replay = state\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    Num Messages:  8 Next:  ()\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Num Messages:  7 Next:  ('chatbot',)\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Num Messages:  6 Next:  ('tools',)\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Num Messages:  5 Next:  ('chatbot',)\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Num Messages:  4 Next:  ('__start__',)\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Num Messages:  4 Next:  ()\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Num Messages:  3 Next:  ('chatbot',)\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Num Messages:  2 Next:  ('tools',)\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Num Messages:  1 Next:  ('chatbot',)\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Num Messages:  0 Next:  ('__start__',)\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    \n[/code]\n\n**Notice** that checkpoints are saved for every step of the graph. This **spans invocations** so you can rewind across a full thread's history. We've picked out `to_replay` as a state to resume from. This is the state after the `chatbot` node in the second graph invocation above.\n\nResuming from this point should call the **action** node next.\n[code] \n    print(to_replay.next)\n    print(to_replay.config)\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    ('tools',)\n    {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1efd43e3-0c1f-6c4e-8006-891877d65740'}}\n    \n[/code]\n\n**Notice** that the checkpoint's config (`to_replay.config`) contains a `checkpoint_id` **timestamp**. Providing this `checkpoint_id` value tells LangGraph's checkpointer to **load** the state from that moment in time. Let's try it below:\n[code] \n    # The `checkpoint_id` in the `to_replay.config` corresponds to a state we've persisted to our checkpointer.\n    for event in graph.stream(None, to_replay.config, stream_mode=\"values\"):\n        if \"messages\" in event:\n            event[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\n    \n[/code]\n[code] \n    ==================================\u001b[1m Ai Message \u001b[0m==================================\n    \n    [{'text': \"That's an exciting idea!
